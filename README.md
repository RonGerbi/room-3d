# OpenGL Adventure  

Welcome to my OpenGL project! This was a college project that turned into a fun dive into the world of computer graphics. From lighting and shadows to textures and rotations—this little project taught me a lot about what it takes to make 3D graphics work.

## Why I Built This  

It started as a college project for my computer graphics course, but it quickly became more than just grades—I wanted to prove I could make shapes look cool *and* move without breaking everything. I picked OpenGL because why not dive headfirst into the deep end? Spoiler: I survived, and I actually had fun. Now it’s here, and I hope it inspires someone else to pick up graphics programming (or at least appreciate the chaos behind it).
